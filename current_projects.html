							Mazinyane is a pre-school that focuses on supplying healthy meals to pre-schoolers as well as focussing on teaching English languages skills preparing children for schooling years ahead. In conjunction with Reservations Africa this school opened in 2002, with the day to day co-ordination and assistance managed through the foundation and the community team from Sabi Sabi.  What originally started with 85 children has now grown to 350-450 – with 5 classrooms and a total of 18 staff.
                        </p>
                        <p class="whoWeAreText padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive">
							The philosophy of both Reservations Africa and Sabi Sabi is that children represent our future and we believe that the Mazinyane Pre-School, supported by both our efforts, is one of the most rewarding community projects in operation.  Many of the children attending the pre-school are the children and  grand-children of staff members of Sabi Sabi, and this environment is vital to these staff so that they are afforded care and basic education whilst their parents are at work.

							In this technological age, life without access to the internet or smart devices means not being able to stay up-to-date with news and global developments, no contact via social media platforms and no opportunity to further your career by compiling a CV, on a word-processing programme and e-mailing it to the appropriate recipient.					
						</p>
						<p class="whoWeAreText padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive">
							In the current global economy and digital market place, 21st century skills are demanded from young people. However access to digital technology is limited in the largely impoverished rural communities adjacent to Sabi Sabi. Here students lack basic opportunities to become proficient in the main language of access: English and digital literacy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="whoWeAreText padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive"">
							Educational programmes at the Lillydale Digital Learning Centre focuses on teaching children from
							the surrounding villages basic literacy and maths in order to prepare themselves for further
							education. It also offers a Bridging Academy for all school leavers and second chance learners, who
							wish to improve their knowledge in this technological age and determine career paths to which they
							are suited and well prepared.

							The GWF (Good Work Foundation) – with whom Sabi Sabi proudly partners in this initiative –
							reported that at the end of 2019 some 516 learners were positively impacted and to date (June
							2020) they have reached 427 learners – this includes both the Open Learning and Bridging Academy
							programmes. GWF’s goal is to work toward impacting 27,000 individuals once all clusters are fully
							operational and the full scope of campuses completed.

							Orphans and vulnerable children living in rural communities face tremendous challenges and the Swa Vana Care Centre is a Sabi Sabi Foundation supported initiative operating within the community. It comprises a care centre for HIV orphans and vulnerable youth, where day care facilities are available for children living with guardians. The centre delivers meals, educational activities and a safe after-school environment for children.  
							Named Swa Vana – meaning “for the children” in the local Tsonga language – the project initially
							looked after only six children and now supports up to 390 children. Today the Section 21 Non-Profit company employs over 31 staff members to facilitate the enormous need for caretakers, social workers and assistants who all work together at the Swa Vana drop-in centres in Huntington, Lillydale and Justicia.

							<br/> <br/>

							These centres provide daily cooked meals, distribution of clothing donations and hygiene items as well as transport for the children to hospitals and clinics when necessary. Organised sport activities, arts and crafts and board games are implemented to assist their cognitive and emotional development. Counselling, social services referrals and regular home visits are conducted to assess needs and 

							Swa Vana furthermore runs a rural enterprise development programme as well as a home-based care programme.  The rural enterprise development programme is aimed at providing the children from the Swa Vana project with a sense of purpose and becoming employable, self-sustainable and valued members of their community. 
							Home-based care is part of Swa Vana’s involvement and consists of a group of community members who attend to the sick, disabled and elderly surviving in desperate circumstances.

                        <p class="whoWeAreText padding-2 padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive">
							Since 2008, a partnership between Sabi Sabi and Dreamfields has offered opportunities to rural school children through encouraging team participation in two very popular sports – soccer and netball.  At Sabi Sabi, we believe that teamwork, whether through sports or in the workplace, builds character and discourages being drawn into negative environments and influences.  This initiative has grown exponentially since our partnership. <br/> <br/>
							A structured soccer and netball league, for both primary and secondary schools in the greater Lillydale community, was set up in 2008.  Participating schools received a soccer and netball kit during an official handover ceremony at the start of the league, and these have since been replaced on a regular basis with upgraded kits. Part of this initiative includes providing professional assistance to all team coaches through Coaching Clinics for soccer and netball during off season, providing the best possible training to all participators. Local referees in the area also benefit greatly - similar to Coaching Clinics, Referee Training Clinics for both soccer and netball are arranged to ensure all games are handled in a fair manner and within the rules of the game.

							The Sabi Sabi / Dreamfields Sports initiative contributes not only to the physical well-being of our children within the local community, but on an academic front as well.
							The Sabi Sabi / Dreamfields Sports initiative is about building dreams, building relationships and fostering a healthy outlook on life. It is fantastic that we have this opportunity to witness children playing sports they love while learning about themselves.

                        <p class="whoWeAreText padding-2 padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive">
							Since 2015 Sabi Sabi has supported a culinary educational programme originally proposed by Wilfred Mtshali, Head Chef at Sabi Sabi Bush Lodge.  Chef Wilfred realised that there was untapped talent going to waste within the community. Without training, school leaving youngsters showing interest in entering the culinary field had no chance of a future within the industry and together with Sabi Sabi Wilfred has provided support to mentor and teach a new generation of chefs.
							Support is provided in the form of transport, housing, uniforms and certification to aspiring cooks from communities adjacent to our reserve.  Following interviews with potential candidates, trainees are selected and registered with the South African Chefs Association (SACA). Week long kitchen courses, ranging from basic to intensive, are presented in Johannesburg by SACA and trainees receive certification upon completion of these levels. 
							
                        </p>
                        <p class="whoWeAreText padding-5 whoWeAreTextResponsive">
							For the remainder of the year, the students alternate their training, spending three months at a time in the kitchens at each of our 4 lodges - Earth Lodge, Little Bush Camp, Bush Lodge and Selati Camp. Once their internship is completed, a final stint in the Bush Lodge kitchen, under the watchful eye of Wilfred is undertaken, leaving students equipped with culinary skills and sufficient knowledge to further their careers. 
							The opportunity of being employed by Sabi Sabi at the end of their yearlong internship is a possibility for all Wilfred’s students and many of the interns that have successfully completed the internship have found gainful employment.
